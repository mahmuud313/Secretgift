        <p>
            My Saddonti, my love, my everything,<br>
            Happy Valentine’s Day, my beautiful girl Saddonti. I don’t even know where to start because no words can truly capture how much you mean to me. From the moment you walked into my life, everything became brighter, warmer, and so much more beautiful. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and every single day, I thank the universe for bringing you into my world.<br><br>

            You are not just a normal girl, you're my girl, my home, my heart, and my safest place. You're my everything ❤️<br><br>

            I get lost in your eyes every time I look at you—they hold so much love, so much depth, and they pull me in like nothing else ever could. And your hair, soft and perfect, is just another thing about you that I can never get enough of. But beyond all that, it’s your heart, your kindness, and the way you make me feel that truly makes you the most special person in my life.<br><br>

            I’ll never forget that day at the cinema—how we sat close, whispering, laughing, completely in our own little world. It wasn’t about the movie at all; it was about us. About the way I felt every time you smiled at me, about the way your presence made even that simple moment feel like magic. That’s what you do, Saddonti. You make everything better, just by being you.<br><br>

            You are not just my girlfriend—you are my best friend, my safe place, my home, my wife, my daughter, my girlfriend, my mother, my mermaid. You are the best surprise of my life. With you, every day is a new adventure, and I can’t wait to keep creating memories with you, to keep loving you more and more with every passing second. No matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, my heart will always belong to you.<br><br>

            I love you, my Saddonti. Today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.<br><br>

            Forever yours,<br>
            I want to tell you that I'm not handsome, not smart, not perfect, and not rich but just simply a loverboy who can give you a lifetime of loyalty.<br><br>
